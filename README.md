# DCE w/ DSD Prototypes

This repository contains a collection of potential DCE prototypes that attempt to handle and make use of existing
Declarative Shadow DOM interfaces. Each top-level folder contains an independent proposal, implementation, and
documentation.

If you have a legacy link to this repository, you'll almost certainly want to go to `/define-element` (the original
content of this repository).

>
> Based on the discussions in the Web Components Community Discord, I'll be updating the proposals and making new ones
> to reflect the latest feedback and suggestions. You can follow or join the dedicated discussion on discord here:
